# Pin blake3 and constant_time_eq to versions compatible with Solana's bundled Rust compiler
# Issue: constant_time_eq v0.4.2 (released Feb 20, 2026) requires Rust Edition 2024
# The bundled Solana compiler doesn't support Edition 2024 feature in Cargo 1.79.0
# Solution: Direct dependencies force specific versions in dependency resolution
